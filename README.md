# Just Play Frontend Application

The frontend app is right now deployed on a Vercel url:
https://justplay-ecru.vercel.app/

The app is connected to the api through http://localhost:3001. 
 
You can find the Api repo on the following url:
https://github.com/Sonrak141/justPlayApi

For the app to work, you must run the api repo on a local server.

Thanks for the consideration, and I will be happy to receive any feedback from you.
